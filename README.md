# ImmersiveTouch
With this mod you will receive vibrations in your VR controllers when hand colliders interacts with dynamic bones.
This mod should work with other mods that allows you to interact with peoples dynamic bones such as "MultiplayerDynamicBones".
The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.
Please note that the avatar you are wearing requires hand colliders for this mod to function correctly.
